---

RuneScript keeps ActionScript's identity (`package`, `trace`, `int`/`uint`,
`public`/`protected`/`private`) and changes the syntax to a C-family style:
types come before names, every function starts with an access modifier
(`public int add(int a, int b)`) instead of a `function` keyword, and
semicolons are required. Its type checking is strict: nothing is implicitly `any`, and
signed and unsigned integers never mix silently.

It runs as a standalone program: no browser, no HTML, no Flash Player.
It can also compile to a JavaScript module for the web, with the same
strict typing and the same runtime errors.
It is **not** source-compatible with ActionScript 3.

```actionscript
package main;

public void sayHi(string message, int times) {
    for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
        trace(message);
    }
}

protected int main() {
    sayHi("Hello world", 3);
    return 0;
}
```

## Status: v0.6 in progress (early development)

**Works now**, and is covered by tests:

- Packages; functions declared `public|private|protected <type> <name>(…)`; recursion;
  the entry point `protected int main()`, whose result is the exit status
- Nested functions, prototypes, function types (`int(int, int)`), callbacks, and lambdas (`(int a) => a * 2`)
- `int`/`sint`, `uint`, `bool`, `string`, `void`
- Variables, `=`, `+= -= *= /= %=`, `++`/`--`; `int n;` starts at the zero
  value (there is no `null`); shadowing in nested blocks, with a warning
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- `if`/`else if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `return`
- `trace(...)`
- Standard library: `use "std:string";` gives Go's `strings` functions as `string.toUpper(s)` and so on
- Multi-file programs: `use "geom";` loads the package in `geom/*.rsm`, and
  `use "./lib/x.rsc";` loads one file; `public`/`protected`/`private` are
  enforced ([guide](docs/guide/12-packages-and-files.md))
- `float` (float32 by default, widening without loss), `float32`, `float64`;
  IEEE 754 with `NaN` and `Infinity`, as in ActionScript
- Checked C-style conversions: `(int) 64.3`, `(float) "64.7"`, `(uint) n`
  ([guide](docs/guide/13-floats-and-conversions.md))
- Exact-width integers `int8` … `uint64` (64-bit values are BigInts in
  JavaScript), hex/binary/octal literals with `_` separators, bit
  operators, and `std:math`, whose results are bit-identical on both
  targets ([guide](docs/guide/18-numbers.md))
- Structs: value types built with `Point{x: 1, y: 2}`, copied on
  assignment, compared field by field ([guide](docs/guide/19-structs.md))
- Text and lists for scripting: `+` and `$"{count} files"` for strings,
  `char`, and `Array<T>` with bounds-checked indexing, nested arrays,
  `for each (T x in a)` loops, slicing, searching, and stable sorting
  ([guide](docs/guide/16-text-and-arrays.md)); `std:string` covers Go's
  `strings` package, including `split`, `fields`, `join`, and callbacks
  ([guide](docs/guide/10-std-string.md))
- ActionScript-style errors: `throw new RangeError("…")`,
  `try`/`catch (Error e)`/`catch (e)`/`finally`; runtime errors are catchable
  ([guide](docs/guide/14-errors.md))
- Compile-time type checking with located diagnostics, including rejection
  of signed → unsigned assignment
- Integer overflow and division by zero are reported as runtime errors and
  never wrap silently; intermediate `int`/`uint` results widen exactly, so
  `big * big / big` works ([guide](docs/guide/04-operators.md#overflow-never-wraps-silently))
- Files, input, and output on both targets: `std:io` (print without a
  newline, red error and yellow warning lines, standard input), `std:process`
  (arguments, environment), `std:fs` (files and directories), and `std:path`
  (Node.js's path rules, implemented in RuneScript's runtimes)
  ([guide](docs/guide/20-files-and-input.md))
- Compilation to JavaScript (`runescript build`): an ES2015 module (plus BigInt and `??`) that runs
  in browsers and Node.js and behaves exactly like the interpreter for every
  program the interpreter can run ([guide](docs/guide/11-javascript.md))
- Web pages with `rune:dom`: components with HTML and SVG templates whose
  every element and attribute is checked at compile time, escaped `{{ }}`
  text, `$if`/`$elseif`/`$else`, events, and runes (signals) that update
  exactly what read them, with no virtual DOM
  ([guide](docs/guide/15-web-pages.md), [examples](examples/web/))
- Calling JavaScript through `extern` declarations, including the
  host-neutral `rune:fs`. Every value that comes back from JavaScript is
  checked against its declared type
- Warnings for unused variables, parameters, and uses, unreachable code,
  discarded results, and shadowing, with `-Werror` and `--allow <code>`;
  errors in red and warnings in yellow on a terminal (`--color`)
- Live reload while you work: `runescript dev app.rsc` serves a web program
  and reloads the browser on every save; `runescript run --watch` re-runs a
  command-line program

**On JavaScript compatibility:** RuneScript does not yet promise full
JavaScript compatibility. What it promises is strict code: unlike
TypeScript, which trusts its declarations and erases them, RuneScript
checks every value that crosses in from JavaScript, and it has no `any`, no
implicit conversions, and no unchecked casts.

**Not yet implemented:** classes, binary files, `go:`
packages, `std:symrs`, objects, arrays, structs, and callbacks across the
JavaScript boundary, `$foreach` and component tags in templates, and the
planned native graphics package. See the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Install

Requires Go 1.25+ ([go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/)); the installer checks it,
builds the `runescript` CLI, and adds it to your PATH.

```sh
# Linux, macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AurielSolaris/runescript/main/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AurielSolaris/runescript/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Options, uninstalling, and installing from a clone are in the
[getting-started guide](docs/guide/01-getting-started.md).

## Build and run from source

```sh
go build -o runescript ./cmd/runescript
./runescript run examples/hello.rsc
./runescript check examples/signedness_error.rsc   # shows a compile-time error
./runescript build examples/fizzbuzz.rsc            # writes examples/fizzbuzz.js
node examples/fizzbuzz.js                         # runs it (Node.js 24+)
./runescript dev examples/fizzbuzz.rsc              # serves it, reloading on every save
./runescript run --watch examples/hello.rsc         # runs it again on every save
./runescript run examples/brainfuck.rsc examples/bf/hello.bf   # arguments follow the file
go test ./...
```

> RuneScript programs use the `.rsc` extension, and package directories hold
> `.rsm` files. Like Perl, the extension is a convention: the CLI and file
> `use`s accept any file name, as long as the file contains RuneScript.

## Tests

```sh
go test ./...                                  # unit, golden, docs, and CLI tests
go test ./tests -run '^$' -fuzz=FuzzCheck      # fuzz the parser and checker
go test ./tests -run '^$' -fuzz=FuzzRun        # fuzz the interpreter
```

The suite includes:
- unit tests for every compiler stage;
- golden tests that run every example and compare its output;
- error programs whose expected diagnostics are written inline as
  `// expect: CODE line:col`;
- runtime-error programs;
- differential tests that run every program on both the interpreter and
  Node.js and require identical results (skipped if `node` is missing);
- Node.js runs of programs that call JavaScript through `extern`, including
  JavaScript that returns wrong values on purpose;
- a check that generated JavaScript uses nothing newer than ES2015 plus
  `BigInt`, `??`, and modules;
- tests for the dev server, the file watcher, and `run --watch`;
- a check that every program in the documentation compiles, and that the
  translations keep every code block of the English pages.

## Examples

[`examples/`](examples/README.md) has programs for every feature: the
basics, `std:string`, callbacks and lambdas, a prime counter, a
[Brainfuck interpreter](examples/brainfuck.rsc) with 32,768 cells, two
programs the compiler rejects on purpose, and web pages in
[`examples/web/`](examples/web/) (a static page, a counter, a toggle, an
SVG dial, and a multi-file app). Every example's output is checked by the
test suite; the web examples run on a fake DOM under Node.js.
